# To-Do-List

To-do list app created using JavaScipt as part of the Odin Project curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

To-do list has projects or separate lists of todos. Users can create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

Application logic and DOM-related logic are kept in separate modules.

The User Interface can do the following:

- view all projects
- view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate. changes color for different priorities)
- expand a single todo to see/edit its details
- delete a todo
  Projects (and todos) saved to localStorage every time a new project (or todo) is created, and data retrieved from localStorage when app is first loaded.
